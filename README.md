# ML_Project_AK

Project Overview
In this project, we'll predict who will win basketball games in the NBA. We'll start by web scraping NBA box scores. We'll read in and clean the html using BeautifulSoup. Then we'll parse the box scores into pandas DataFrames that we can use for machine learning. Then we'll do feature selection to identify good predictors, and train a machine learning model to make predictions. We'll end by computing rolling predictors and improving the model.

This is a complete end-to-end project, and we'll be using web scraping, data cleaning, and machine learning.
